                        <h2>Media Industry Scenario</h2>
                        <p>Traditionally, the film business been thought of as a high-risk area with only a small chance of providing investor returns. But in recent years, the investment climate has changed dramatically.</p> 

                        <p>The advent of the DVD format and the growth in international markets have established steady flows of predictable revenue streams. This fundamental shift has encouraged new classes of sophisticated investors, such as hedge funds and private equity firms, to look to the film sector for higher returns with a risk profile unrelated to traditional investments.</p>

                        <p>As a result, film is now seen as a valid and attractive asset class in its own right. At least 30% of all studio movies are now made in partnership with third-party funding and the concept of “slate finance” is acknowledged to lower costs, reduce risks and raise returns for studios and investors alike.</p>
