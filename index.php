                        <h2>Media Industry Scenario</h2>
                        <p>Traditionally, the film business been thought of as a high-risk area with only a small chance of providing investor returns. But in recent years, the investment climate has changed dramatically.</p>
                        <p>The advent of the DVD format and the growth in international markets have established steady flows of predictable revenue streams. This fundamental shift has encouraged new classes of sophisticated investors, such as hedge funds and private equity firms, to look to the film sector for higher returns with a risk profile unrelated to traditional investments.</p>
                        <p>As a result, film is now seen as a valid and attractive asset class in its own right. At least 30% of all studio movies are now made in partnership with third-party funding and the concept of “slate finance” is acknowledged to lower costs, reduce risks and raise returns for studios and investors alike.</p>

                    <h2>The SFF Model</h2>
                    <p>Our model is built upon the conviction that a diversified portfolio of carefully chosen feature films is not correlated to traditional investment markets and indices, but rather that movie assets will continue to grow, building on the industry’s performance in the past two decades of recession-resistant growth.</p>

                    <p id="forecasting">Conservatively forecasting annualised returns to investors in the range of 15-20%.</p>

                        <h2>Music Rights as a Revenue Stream</h2>
                        <p class="first">Through the creation of a Film Soundtrack, Soho Film Finance will take an active part in the Film production hence the Music Production is a central part of what Soho Film Finance is about.</p>

                        <p>Music Producer and Composer Tom Linden has a proven Track record in writing and placing Music for Film &amp; Television. Tom has written the Channel 5 News music and his Compositions and Soundscapes have been used in TV Series such as Top Gear &amp; Green Wing, Documentaries including Northern Skies, as Idents for Desperate Housewives, MTV Cribs &amp; Discovery Channel and on Worldwide Adverts for Baileys, Orange, Visa, Amnesty International &amp; Firetrap. His Compositions feature regularly on all major Broadcasters.</p> 

                        <p>Through his work he realised the importance of owning copyrights and publishing rights as another revenue stream for Investors. According to each individual Film and negotiations this may give the Investor a double opportunity to gain profits from both the Film Revenue and the Music rights. The Music rights can generate other income from sources such as Soundtrack, Licensing, TV deals, Royalties from international ticket sales and Sheet music sales.</p>
